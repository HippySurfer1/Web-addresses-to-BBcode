# Web-addresses-to-BBcode
This needs AutoHotKey installed to be able to run.


Format_Web converts URL's in a text file to BBCode url with inputs for  color,label and description  
[url=http://abc.com][b][color=#00843D]%Label%[/url][/color][/b][color=#FFCD00]%Description%[/color]

I haven't worked out %USERPROFILE% and I hate formatting so everything runs from C:\Format_Dread
You need a file Web.txt to put the addresses in.
